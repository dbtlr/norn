//! The MCP server handler.
//!
//! Task 1 is the scaffold: an empty tool router with zero `#[tool]` methods, so
//! `tools/list` answers with an empty array. Later tasks add `#[tool]` methods.
//!
//! Task 13 splits the tools into two `#[tool_router]` blocks — `read_router`
//! (the 7 read tools) and `mutate_router` (the 7 mutation tools) — merged
//! together by `McpServer::new` into one served surface (see `routers`).
//!
//! Task 2 wires in a warm [`VaultContext`] so tool implementations can call
//! `self.ctx.query_cache()` to open a fresh cache handle on each invocation —
//! getting the CLI's per-invocation freshness check without a filesystem watcher.
//!
//! We use the explicit `#[tool_handler(router = self.tool_router)]` form (rather
//! than `#[tool_router(server_handler)]`) so the generated `ServerHandler`
//! dispatches through the *instance* `tool_router` field. The `server_handler`
//! convenience variant instead routes through a fresh `Self::tool_router()` each
//! call, which would leave the field unread and trip `-D dead_code`.
